# Ofy

A self-hosted, Spotify-style web app for **browsing music via MusicBrainz**, **downloading** songs and
albums from **YouTube Music**, **tagging** them completely with MusicBrainz metadata (Picard-compatible, so
Jellyfin / Navidrome / Plex / Picard read them correctly), and fetching **lyrics** from **LRCLIB**.

```
Search ─▶ Artist ─▶ Album (pick edition) ─▶ Download
                                         │
            match on YT Music (album → per-song fallback, confidence 0–1)
                                         │
     yt-dlp bestaudio ─▶ ffmpeg (mp3 / m4a / opus) ─▶ tag (ID3v2.4 / MP4 / Vorbis) + cover
                                         │
                  LRCLIB lyrics (.lrc / .txt sidecar + embedded) ─▶ atomic move into library
```

* **Backend**: Python 3.12, FastAPI, SQLModel/SQLite, httpx, ytmusicapi, yt-dlp (as a library), ffmpeg,
  mutagen, rapidfuzz — managed with `uv`.
* **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui-style components + TanStack Query.

---

## Quick start

Requirements: Python 3.12, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node 18+, ffmpeg (and ideally `deno` or
Node ≥ 20 on `PATH` for yt-dlp, see [Updating yt-dlp](#updating-yt-dlp)).

```bash
./build.sh          # install backend + frontend dependencies and build the UI
./run.sh            # open the desktop app (builds first if anything is missing or out of date)
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./build.sh` | `uv sync` (backend) + `npm ci` (frontend, skipped when up to date) + `npm run build` |
| `./build.sh --clean` | Same, after deleting `backend/.venv`, `frontend/node_modules` and `frontend/dist` |
| `./build.sh --test` | Same, then runs the backend unit tests |
| `./run.sh` | Desktop app (native window). Extra args go to `ofy-desktop`, e.g. `./run.sh desktop --debug` |
| `./run.sh web [--port 8080]` | Web server only; UI at http://localhost:8080 |
| `./run.sh dev` | Backend with auto-reload on :8080 + Vite dev server with hot reload on http://localhost:5173 (proxies `/api`); Ctrl-C stops both |

`run.sh` rebuilds automatically when the virtualenv or `node_modules` is missing or older than its
lockfile, or (for `desktop`/`web`) when any UI source is newer than `frontend/dist`. To add Ofy to
your app menu: `cd backend && uv run ofy-desktop --install-shortcut`.

### Desktop app

`ofy-desktop` starts the backend in a background thread (listening on `127.0.0.1` only) and shows
the UI in a native window via [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/). Closing the window stops the
backend. If a backend for the same data directory is already running (another window, or the web server
below) the window attaches to it instead of starting a second job queue on the same database.

* Music goes to `~/Music/Ofy` by default (change it in Settings).
* App state (SQLite DB, MusicBrainz/YT caches, cover cache, temp files) lives in
  `~/.local/share/ofy` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/ofy`).
* Upgrading from the app's former name (Offliner): `~/.local/share/offliner` is moved to `~/.local/share/ofy`
  automatically on first start (only when the new folder doesn't exist yet and the old app isn't running).
* Set `OFY_CONTACT=you@example.com` so the MusicBrainz/LRCLIB User-Agent carries a contact, as
  MusicBrainz asks.

**Webview backends.** On Linux the window uses GTK + WebKitGTK. PyGObject has no pip wheels, so the
launcher reuses the distro's bindings (only `gi`/`cairo` are linked into the virtualenv):

```bash
sudo apt install python3-gi gir1.2-webkit2-4.1 gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-good   # Debian/Ubuntu
```

`gstreamer1.0-libav` provides AAC/MP3 decoding for the player. Without GTK, use the Qt backend instead:
`uv sync --extra qt && uv run ofy-desktop --gui qt`. macOS (WebKit) and Windows (Edge WebView2)
need nothing extra.

`uv run ofy-desktop --selftest [--play /api/stream/<recording-mbid>]` opens the window, checks
that the UI renders and which audio codecs the webview supports, optionally plays a stream, prints a
JSON report and exits; use it to diagnose a machine.

### Web server mode

The same app also runs as a plain web server (e.g. on a home server, used from any browser):
`./run.sh web`, or directly `cd backend && uv run python -m ofy` (UI on http://localhost:8080).

## Development

`./run.sh dev` is the usual loop: edit Python under `backend/src` or TypeScript under `frontend/src` and
both reload. The individual pieces, if you prefer separate terminals:

```bash
cd backend && uv run uvicorn ofy.main:app --port 8080 --reload --reload-dir src
cd frontend && npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173, proxies /api to :8080
```

### Tests

```bash
cd backend
uv run pytest                 # unit tests (offline)
uv run pytest -m network      # live tests against MusicBrainz + YouTube Music
```

Unit tests cover: match scoring and album/track mapping, path templating & sanitizing, status
aggregation, the MusicBrainz rate limiter, MusicBrainz → tag-model mapping (recorded JSON fixtures in
`tests/fixtures`), every tag writer (round-trip on tiny ffmpeg-generated mp3/m4a/opus files), LRCLIB
result selection, `.lrc` formatting and sidecar handling, the job queue (retry, backoff, persistence,
concurrency) and "Refresh tags" (asserts no YouTube access and an unchanged audio stream).

### Useful commands

```bash
# Matcher CLI: prints the chosen YT Music album and per-track matches + scores
uv run python -m ofy.match "Radiohead" "OK Computer"
uv run python -m ofy.match "Nirvana" "Nevermind" --threshold 0.8 -v

# Verify a downloaded album folder against MusicBrainz (tags, MBIDs, cover, ID3v2.4, sidecars)
uv run python scripts/verify_album.py "music/Radiohead/1997 - OK Computer" <release-mbid> --format mp3

# Headless browser smoke test of the UI (needs chromium)
uv run python scripts/ui_check.py --base http://localhost:8080
```

## Configuration

Environment variables (bootstrap, read at start):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `OFY_DATA_DIR` | `~/.local/share/ofy` | SQLite DB, caches, temp files |
| `OFY_LIBRARY_DIR` | `~/Music/Ofy` | Default library root |
| `OFY_PORT` / `OFY_HOST` | `8080` / `0.0.0.0` (desktop: `127.0.0.1`) | HTTP listen address; the desktop app falls back to a free port if 8080 is taken |
| `OFY_CONTACT` | empty | Contact (email/URL) appended to the User-Agent |
| `OFY_STATIC_DIR` | `<repo>/frontend/dist` | Built frontend to serve |
| `OFY_MUSICBRAINZ_URL` | `https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2` | MusicBrainz WS/2 base (e.g. a mirror) |
| `OFY_SCAN_ON_STARTUP` | `1` | Reconcile DB with disk at startup |

Settings page (persisted in the DB, editable at runtime):

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Library path | `OFY_LIBRARY_DIR` | Root folder for downloads |
| Path template | `{albumartist}/{album}/{artist} - {title}.{ext}` | See below |
| Output format | `mp3` | `mp3` (re-encode), `m4a` (copy when the source is AAC), `opus` (copy) |
| MP3 quality | `320` | `320` kbps CBR or `v0` VBR |
| Concurrent downloads | `2` | Size of the download worker pool |
| Max retries | `3` | Exponential backoff with jitter between attempts |
| Match threshold | `0.7` | Below → track becomes **needs review** |
| Fetch lyrics / Prefer synced / Embed in tags | on / on / on | LRCLIB behaviour |
| LRCLIB URL | `https://lrclib.net` | Point elsewhere (e.g. self-hosted LRCLIB) |
| cookies.txt path | empty | Optional Netscape cookies file for yt-dlp (age-restricted content) |

**Path template fields**: `albumartist artist album title year date originalyear disc disctotal track
tracktotal ext media releasetype catalognumber label albumartistsort artistsort`. Python format specs
work (`{track:02}`). `{year}` is the release group's original year (stable across reissues). Every path
component is sanitized: characters illegal on Windows/macOS/Linux (`<>:"/\|?*` and control characters)
become `_`, leading/trailing dots and spaces are removed, Windows reserved names (`CON`, `NUL`, …) get a
suffix, and each component is limited to 180 bytes (the extension is preserved). Values can never create
extra directories (`AC/DC` → `AC_DC`). The default produces e.g. `Pink Floyd/Meddle/Pink Floyd - Echoes.mp3`
(and `Pink Floyd - Echoes.lrc` next to it); `{artist}` is the track's artist credit. If two tracks of a
release render to the same name (the same song twice, or on several discs) the later one gets a
` (disc-track)` suffix instead of overwriting. Add `{disc}-{track:02} - ` to the template if you prefer
numbered files.

## How it works

### MusicBrainz

* WS/2 JSON with a **strict global limit of 1 request/second** (one shared limiter, serialized across
  all coroutines), a descriptive User-Agent, retries on 503, and an SQLite response cache with TTLs
  (searches 1 day, entities 3–7 days).
* Artist pages group release groups into **Album, Single/EP, Compilation, Live** (and Other), plus
  related artists from artist–artist relationships.
* The canonical edition of a release group is chosen as **Official > Digital Media/CD > earliest date**
  (precise dates beat year-only dates; ties prefer worldwide/major-market releases). Any edition can be
  selected in the album page's edition picker.
* For tagging, the selected release is fetched once with
  `inc=recordings+artist-credits+labels+isrcs+genres+release-groups+media`.
* Artist photos come from Wikidata/Wikimedia Commons (MusicBrainz has none): the artist's Wikidata item
  (MusicBrainz's `wikidata` link, or a lookup by MusicBrainz artist ID, property P434) and its image
  (P18), as a Commons thumbnail. Without a photo, the artist page uses the cover of the artist's newest
  album. Lookups are cached (30 days, 7 for "no photo"), throttled to 1 request/s, and on HTTP 429 all
  Wikimedia requests pause for the server's `Retry-After`.
* Cover art comes from the Cover Art Archive (`front-1200`, falling back to the original image, then to
  the release group's cover) and is cached on disk.

### Matching (YouTube Music)

* **Strategy A (album)**: search `filter="albums"`, score candidates on title / artist / year / track
  count, fetch the best ones and map tracks one-to-one by **position + title + duration (±5 s)**. Album
  entries that point at music videos are replaced by their **Art Track** from the album's audio
  playlist.
* **Strategy B (per song)**: `filter="songs"`; prefers Art Tracks over videos and penalizes
  live / remix / cover / sped up / slowed / karaoke / instrumental / acoustic… unless the MusicBrainz
  title contains the same word.
* MusicBrainz tracks that combine several songs (e.g. `Something in the Way / Endless, Nameless` with a
  hidden track) are matched to the consecutive YT tracks and **concatenated** at download time.
* Every match stores a **0–1 confidence**, its source (`album`, `song`, `manual`) and the top 5
  candidates. Below the threshold the track is **needs review**: the track drawer lists candidates
  (with links to listen on YT Music) and "Use this" persists a manual choice that is never overridden
  by automatic re-matching.
* All YouTube Music calls go through one throttled client (≈1 request/s with jitter) and are cached.

### Downloading

* Persistent job queue in SQLite (jobs survive restarts; interrupted jobs resume), configurable
  concurrency, retries with exponential backoff + jitter, and a random pause before each download.
* yt-dlp (`bestaudio`, preferring the codec that can be kept) → ffmpeg → tag → lyrics → **atomic move**
  (temp file in the destination directory, `fsync`, `rename`). The front cover is only embedded in
  the files (no `cover.jpg` is written).
* Live progress (`matching → downloading → converting → tagging → lyrics → done`) is pushed over the
  WebSocket at `/api/ws`.

### Library state

* Track status: `none | queued | downloading | done | failed | needs_review`; lyrics status:
  `none | synced | plain | instrumental | not_found`.
* Album status is derived: `none | partial | complete` (shown on cards and album headers).
* The **library scanner** runs at startup and from the Library page's **Rescan** button. It walks the
  library, reads MusicBrainz ids from tags for unknown files, and reconciles: deleted audio → track back
  to `none` (album becomes `partial`); moved files are followed; files added outside the app (with MBID
  tags) are adopted; `.lrc`/`.txt` sidecars added or removed update the lyrics status.
* **Refresh tags** (album page) re-fetches the release from MusicBrainz (bypassing the cache) and
  rewrites tags in place — no YouTube access, the audio stream is untouched. If the new metadata
  renders to a different path, the file and its sidecars are moved.

### Playback

`GET /api/stream/{recording_mbid}` serves the local file with HTTP Range support when downloaded;
otherwise it matches the recording (album context when `?release=` is given), resolves the audio URL with
yt-dlp and proxies it through the backend (Range requests forwarded). The bottom player bar has
play/pause/seek/volume/next/previous, and the lyrics panel highlights the current line of the `.lrc`.

## Lyrics behaviour

1. After tagging, `GET {LRCLIB}/api/get?artist_name=…&track_name=…&album_name=…&duration=…` (duration in
   seconds, from MusicBrainz).
2. On 404 (or an empty record), `GET /api/search` and accept the best result whose **duration is within
   ±2 s** and whose title **and** artist fuzzy-match ≥ 0.8 (synced results preferred).
3. Result handling:
   * `syncedLyrics` (and *prefer synced* on) → `<same basename>.lrc` next to the audio, with
     `[ar:]`, `[al:]`, `[ti:]` and `[length:mm:ss]` headers → status **synced**;
   * else `plainLyrics` → `<same basename>.txt` → status **plain**;
   * `instrumental: true` → nothing saved, status **instrumental**;
   * nothing acceptable → status **not_found**.
4. With *embed in tags* on, the plain text is embedded (ID3 `USLT`, MP4 `©lyr`, Vorbis `LYRICS`); for
   synced-only results the timestamps are stripped.
5. Lyrics are **best effort**: network errors, timeouts or HTTP errors are logged, the track still
   completes as `done` (status stays `none`), and existing sidecars are never deleted because of an error.
6. Requests carry the Ofy User-Agent and are throttled (≥ 0.5 s apart).
7. "Fetch lyrics again" (track drawer) and "Fetch missing lyrics" (album page, Library page) retry
   tracks whose status is `none` or `not_found`.

## Tag mapping

Follows [Picard's tag mapping](https://picard-docs.musicbrainz.org/en/appendices/tag_mapping.html)
(verified against Picard's `formats/id3.py`, `mp4.py`, `vorbis.py`). MP4 freeform atoms are
`----:com.apple.iTunes:<name>`.

| Field (Picard name) | ID3v2.4 (mp3) | MP4 (m4a) | Vorbis (opus) |
|---|---|---|---|
| title | `TIT2` | `©nam` | `TITLE` |
| artist (full credit) | `TPE1` | `©ART` | `ARTIST` |
| artists (multi) | `TXXX:ARTISTS` | `ARTISTS` | `ARTISTS` |
| album | `TALB` | `©alb` | `ALBUM` |
| albumartist | `TPE2` | `aART` | `ALBUMARTIST` |
| albumartists (multi) | `TXXX:ALBUMARTISTS` | `ALBUMARTISTS` | `ALBUMARTISTS` |
| artistsort | `TSOP` | `soar` | `ARTISTSORT` |
| albumartistsort | `TSO2` | `soaa` | `ALBUMARTISTSORT` |
| tracknumber / totaltracks | `TRCK` (`n/t`) | `trkn` | `TRACKNUMBER` / `TRACKTOTAL` |
| discnumber / totaldiscs | `TPOS` (`n/t`) | `disk` | `DISCNUMBER` / `DISCTOTAL` |
| discsubtitle | `TSST` | `DISCSUBTITLE` | `DISCSUBTITLE` |
| date (release date) | `TDRC` | `©day` | `DATE` |
| originaldate (release group first release) | `TDOR` | `originaldate` | `ORIGINALDATE` |
| originalyear | `TXXX:originalyear` | `originalyear` | `ORIGINALYEAR` |
| genre (top MB genres, multi) | `TCON` | `©gen` | `GENRE` |
| label | `TPUB` | `LABEL` | `LABEL` |
| catalognumber | `TXXX:CATALOGNUMBER` | `CATALOGNUMBER` | `CATALOGNUMBER` |
| barcode | `TXXX:BARCODE` | `BARCODE` | `BARCODE` |
| isrc | `TSRC` | `ISRC` | `ISRC` |
| asin | `TXXX:ASIN` | `ASIN` | `ASIN` |
| media | `TMED` | `MEDIA` | `MEDIA` |
| releasetype | `TXXX:MusicBrainz Album Type` | `MusicBrainz Album Type` | `RELEASETYPE` |
| releasestatus | `TXXX:MusicBrainz Album Status` | `MusicBrainz Album Status` | `RELEASESTATUS` |
| releasecountry | `TXXX:MusicBrainz Album Release Country` | `MusicBrainz Album Release Country` | `RELEASECOUNTRY` |
| compilation (album artist is Various Artists) | `TCMP` = `1` | `cpil` | `COMPILATION` = `1` |
| script | `TXXX:SCRIPT` | `SCRIPT` | `SCRIPT` |
| language | `TLAN` | `LANGUAGE` | `LANGUAGE` |
| length (ms) | `TLEN` | `LENGTH` | `LENGTH` |
| lyrics (plain) | `USLT` | `©lyr` | `LYRICS` |
| front cover | `APIC` (type 3) | `covr` | `METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE` (type 3) |
| musicbrainz_recordingid | `UFID:http://musicbrainz.org` | `MusicBrainz Track Id` | `MUSICBRAINZ_TRACKID` |
| musicbrainz_trackid (release track id) | `TXXX:MusicBrainz Release Track Id` | `MusicBrainz Release Track Id` | `MUSICBRAINZ_RELEASETRACKID` |
| musicbrainz_albumid (release id) | `TXXX:MusicBrainz Album Id` | `MusicBrainz Album Id` | `MUSICBRAINZ_ALBUMID` |
| musicbrainz_releasegroupid | `TXXX:MusicBrainz Release Group Id` | `MusicBrainz Release Group Id` | `MUSICBRAINZ_RELEASEGROUPID` |
| musicbrainz_artistid (multi) | `TXXX:MusicBrainz Artist Id` | `MusicBrainz Artist Id` | `MUSICBRAINZ_ARTISTID` |
| musicbrainz_albumartistid (multi) | `TXXX:MusicBrainz Album Artist Id` | `MusicBrainz Album Artist Id` | `MUSICBRAINZ_ALBUMARTISTID` |
| YouTube video id (traceability) | `TXXX:YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` | `YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` | `YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` |

Notes: as in Picard, Vorbis `MUSICBRAINZ_TRACKID` holds the *recording* id and the release-track id is
`MUSICBRAINZ_RELEASETRACKID`. Release type/status are lower-case (`album`, `official`). Genres are the
top 5 genres merged from recording, release and release group by vote count. MP3 files are saved as
ID3v2.4 without an ID3v1 tag. Composite (concatenated) matches store all video ids joined with `+`.

## Updating yt-dlp

YouTube changes frequently; when downloads start failing (403s, "Sign in to confirm", format errors),
update yt-dlp first:

```bash
cd backend
uv lock --upgrade-package yt-dlp --upgrade-package yt-dlp-ejs && uv sync
# then restart Ofy (close and reopen the window, or restart `python -m ofy`)
```

`yt-dlp[default]` pulls in `yt-dlp-ejs` (the JS challenge solver scripts). yt-dlp also needs a JavaScript
runtime on `PATH` to solve YouTube's player challenges: install [Deno](https://deno.com)
(`curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh`) or Node ≥ 20. Without one, extraction still works for now
but some formats may be missing and you may see more HTTP 403s. If YouTube requires sign-in for some
tracks, export cookies from a browser to a `cookies.txt` (Netscape format) and set its path in Settings.
